# Welcome to my Terraform project! 
This project is all about setting up a robust infrastructure for your application using Terraform. Here's what we're going to do:

We'll start by creating a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to provide a private network for your resources. Then, we'll set up subnets within the VPC to logically divide your network and ensure proper isolation.

Next, we'll create two EC2 instances to host your application. These instances will run your application code and handle incoming requests.

To distribute incoming traffic and ensure high availability, we'll set up an Application Load Balancer (ALB). The ALB will intelligently route traffic to your EC2 instances, providing load balancing and fault tolerance.

Additionally, we'll leverage Amazon S3 to store any static assets or files needed by your application.

By using Terraform, we can define our infrastructure as code, making it easy to manage and reproduce. This project streamlines the process of setting up a scalable and resilient infrastructure for your application, ensuring smooth operation and optimal performance.
